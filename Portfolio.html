                        This is a piece of coursework that was written during my first term at Goldsmiths university using C++, OpenGL and the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/octetframework/">Octet framework</a>..

                        For the maths assignment we formed a group of myself and two others to create a procedural terrain which would generate stochastic trees. My part of the project consisted of generating the terrain
                        and positioning the trees. The group I was in had also been working together on the Volumetric project found in the current projects page, we used that as a base for our terrain generation which
                        is why the world is voxel based, we did want to have the trees voxel based aswell but after trials we decided that we just lost too much of the stochastic trees to make it worthwhile so decided for
                        this project to keep the trees the way they were generated through the L-System without voxelising them.

                        This project was a voxel based game intended to be an extension of the Stochastic trees and Perlin noise generation project seen above, we expanded on the ideas above and made a sort of basic Minecraft clone.

                        This is a small physics coursework that was written during my time at Goldsmiths, it's a simple pool game using accurate physics using html and CreateJS.

                        The product is a fully working pool game, with everything created by myself except the CreateJS library which I used for the graphics.

                        This project was created as part of the Global Game Jam 2014 with the theme <span>"We don't see things as they are,

                        The game was created using the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/octetframework/">Octet framework</a>,
                        in C++, while the game was completed we had been a bit ambitious in what we wanted to achieve. The initial
                        idea was a Fez-esque game where you would swap between a platformer style to a top down style game, which we felt fit
                        in with the theme quite nicely, we however came into lots of trouble trying to implement this and in the end
                        settled with a game where you go from top down levels to platformer levels.
