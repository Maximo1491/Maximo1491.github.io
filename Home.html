				Welcome to the online portfolio of <span>Max Morris</span> MSc Computer Games Programmer at <span>Sports Interactive</span>.
			</h1>
			<p>
				This site acts as an on-line CV of sorts. It showcases some of the projects I've worked on with most coming from either
				Sports Interactive or during my time while working towards my MSc at Goldsmiths. It demonstrates (to some degree) my caliber as a games programmer
				and the technologies that I am familiar with. I have also included links with all of my personal projects so you can download and
				have a look at the source code I've produced.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've known since I was 7 that games programming was what I wanted to do with my life, I had just received pokemon red and
                a game-boy colour, ever since then I've been hooked and dedicated my life to try to break into this amazing industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				I previously studied a BSc at London Metropolitan University and a MSc at Goldsmiths, University of London, where I graduated with
				first class honours and distinction respectively, both in Computer Games Programming courses, while there I learnt a wide range of
				programming languages. I am currently working at Sports Interactive as part of the Platform / Tools team where I am responsible for
				a wide range of systems and internal libraries.
