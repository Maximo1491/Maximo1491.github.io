\section*{Hobbies \& Interests}
\vspace{-3mm}
After work and during my weekends, I try to spend as much time as possible with my family and friends, normally either down the pub or spending the evening with a few of my mates fighting around the map in Heroes of the Storm. While current circumstances have seen my gaming sessions take a back-seat to higher priorities, I still try to spend some time playing around with some of the great games out there at the moment.
